# Linux Commands 
1. cd ("chnage directory") -> Change the current working directory.
- cd directory --> If you are changing to a directory that is within your current directory, you can simply type cd and the name of the other directory.
- cd /usr/local/bin --> If you are changing to a directory elsewhere within the filesystem directory tree, provide the path to the directory with a leading /.
- cd ~ --> To quickly return to your home directory, use the ~ (tilde) character as the directory name.
- cd .. --> You can use the double dot symbol .. to represent the parent of the current directory. You can type the following command to go up a directory.
- cd ../directory --> Imagine you are in a directory. The parent directory has other directories in it, as well as the directory youâ€™re currently in. To change into one of those other directories, you can use the .. symbol to shorten what you have to type.

2. ls
- ls -a
- ls -l

3. pwd
